		<h3> Risk Management </h3>
		Identification of potential risks and challenges.

		User feels overwhelmed by information on the website
		Lack of clarity, legibility, and hierarchy
		Low accessibility— e.g low contrast, non-descriptive text links, websites accessible to various devices, etc.
		Bugs, or technical malfunctions that affect user experience.
		Technical Failures
		Hosting server failures
		Scalability concerns - Inability to handle increased traffic to the website
		Responsive design may have limitations due to coding ability
		Communication
		Lack of information exchange when information are revised or added
		Client is unresponsive
		Budget
		Financial constraints hosting costs
		Client refusing to pay

		<h3> Contingency Plans </h3>
		Proposed solutions for potential risks
		Design Challenges
		Lack of user research
		Solution - Use other design tools and strategies (e.g. user testing A/B, client interview, user feedback, etc.).
		Design does not align with client needs and wants
		solution - Client will approve designs and functionality before launching the website.
		User feels overwhelmed by information on the website
		Solution - keep out unnecessary information, be straightforward, and feed the users with the information they WANT to know
		Lack of clarity, legibility, and hierarchy
		Solution - User testing should help identify these requirements. 
		Low accessibility— e.g. low contrast, non-descriptive text links, websites accessible to various devices, etc.
		Solution - Accessibility can be determined through user interview/testing
		Bugs, or technical malfunctions that affect user experience.
		Solution - Most bugs should be found through user testing.
		Technical Failures
		Hosting server failures
		Solution - If the server is being managed by a third party, there’s not a whole lot we can do to maintain availability. If the server is hosted by us we would want redundancy for storage, power, and internet connection. 
		Solution - Research and choose a reliable server
		Scalability concerns - Inability to handle increased traffic to the website
		Solution - Could implement a load balancer to the server (probably won’t for this class).
		Google mobile-friendly test 
		Responsive design may have limitations due to coding ability
		Solution - Test the website on various screen sizes.
		Communication
		Lack of information exchange when information is revised or added
		Solution - update the teams and individuals of changes during meetings.
		Client is unresponsive
		Solution - If the client is unresponsive for two weeks (14 days), the project will be terminated, and fees according to the contract must be paid.
		Budget
		Financial constraints hosting costs
		Client and the team discuss possible solutions and alternatives.
		Client refusing to pay
		Solution - files and documents relevant to the project will be withheld until agreed-upon payment is received.
		Time and resource management
		Tasks are facing unexpected delays 
		Solution - Communicate with the client, team members, and individuals that may be affected by delay. If assistance is needed, please communicate with the team
		Ask peers for help with difficult tasks
		Resource intensive with manpower and time
		Solution - Set strict deadlines for tasks
		Project management and planning
		Content management
		File management
		Solution- All assets (images, videos, and content) are organized within the appropriate folders with proper naming conventions.
		Copyright
		Solution - use creative commons license, open sources (Vimeo and Youtube).
		Keeping data secure
		Solution - Routinely update the software, and use a secure web host.
